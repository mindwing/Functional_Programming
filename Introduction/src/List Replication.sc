/*
Problem Statement

Given a list repeat each element of the list n times. The input and output portions will be handled automatically by the grader. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

Input Format
First line has integer S where S is the number of times you need to repeat elements. After this there are X lines, each containing an integer. These are the X elements of the array.

Output Format
Repeat each element of the original list S times. So you have to return list/vector/array of S*X integers. The relative positions of the values should be same as the original list provided as input.

Constraints
0<=X<=10
1<=S<=100

Recommended Method Signature

Number Of Parameters: 2
Parameters: [number of times to replicate elements, list]
Returns: List or Vector

For Hackers Using other Languages
You have to read input from standard input and write output to standard output. Please follow input/output format mentioned above.

Please note that you only need to submit the code above, after filling in the blanks appropriately. The input and output section will be handled by us. The focus is on writing the correct function.
