/*
Problem Statement

Count the number of elements in an array without using count, size or length operators (or their equivalents). The input and output portions will be handled automatically by the grader. You only need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

Input Format

A list with Integers; each integer is on a new line.

Output Format

A single integer N which is the length of the list which was provided as input.

Sample Input

2
5
1
4
3
7
8
6
0
9
Sample Output

10
Constraints
Number of elements in the list, N is such that 0<=N<=100.
Each element X in the list is such that 0<=X<=100.

Recommended Method Signature

Number Of Parameters: 1
Parameters: [list]
Returns: Number

For Hackers Using other Languages
You have to read input from standard input and write output to standard output. Please follow input/output format mentioned above.

Please note that you only need to submit the code above, after filling in the blanks appropriately. The input and output section will be handled by us. The focus is on writing the correct function.
