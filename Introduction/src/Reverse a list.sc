/*
Problem Statement

Reverse a list without using reverse function. The input and output portions will be handled automatically. You need to write a function with the recommended method signature.

Input and Output Format
Each element of the list is displayed on a new line.
The output list is the reverse of the input list.

Sample Input

19
22
3
28
26

For Hackers Using other Languages
You have to read input from standard input and write output to standard output. Please follow input/output format mentioned above.

Please note that you only need to submit the code above, after filling in the blanks appropriately. The input and output section will be handled by us. The focus is on writing the correct function.
